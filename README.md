# Rosalind_ex

This is the repo of my 'Bioinformatics Training' using Python. 

I have decided to start again trying to connect exercises as in the Rosalind_tree, to make a proper pipeline and I want to present cleaner scripts.

In the old_ex folder the are scripts that I've written in the past when I started on 2017, shame on me.
